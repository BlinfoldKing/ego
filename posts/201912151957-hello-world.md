## It's Just Another Programming Blog

Hello world, I am, Ganesha **Danu** Enastika, a freelance software engineer and currently also a computer science student from _**Indonesia.**_ 

Actually it is not my first time to publish a blog, though in previous run, i don't really have anything to share worthy, but recently i'm pretty confident enough to say that i have learnt from experience. I think it would be nice to write what i have learnt as a way to giving back to the programming community and also a way to experiment my skill by building this blog from scratch.

## What to expect

I am planning to fill this blog mostly about thing about software engineering and programming. I may also post some content in **Bahasa** in order help beginer in Indonesia to learn. but may be there would be some personal and book stuff. And i hove whoever read this find anything interesting in this blog and enjoy your stay.
